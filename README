PyConZA InternetArchive.org Upload Scripts
------------------------------------------

Installation
------------

* 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

Instructions
------------

The file 'videos.yaml' describes the files to be uploaded.

  * Set 'folder: <path-to-the-video-files>'.
  * Set 'upload: true' for any videos you wish to upload.

Set up your access tokens using 'export
IAS3_TOKEN=<access-token>:<secret-key>'. You can find these tokens at
https://archive.org/account/s3.php after logging in.

Then run 'python upload_videos.py'.

By default, new uploads are added to the "Community Videos" unless the
collection is set in the default_metadata section. PyConZA videos
should be uploaded to the 'PyConZA' collection.

You can test uploads to check for issues with the metadata by changing the
collection to "test_collection" - these are only kept for 30 days, but be sure
to use the "PyConZA" collection for the final upload.
