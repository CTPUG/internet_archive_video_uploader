PyConZA internet archive upload helpers
=======================================

convert_youtube_yml_to_videos_yml.py
------------------------------------

This script converts the Debian youtube upload yml file into a suitable videos.yml file.

This is not very robust, and there are a lot of assumptions about how the
description in the youtube.yml file is structured and the hardcoded defaults
for the metadata are very specific to PyConZA. Check the output of this
script carefully, but it should be an acceptable starting point.


fix_metafata.py
---------------

A script that parses a list of internet achive urls, and replaces any
'https://za.pycon.org/' urls with a year-specific site url. Used
to fix talks uploaded by vepyer with incorrect metadata.

It also sets the added_date field (used by IA's sort and search functionality) to
the public date, to fix issues with year filters not working correctly.
